## Updates
##### Jan 24, 2016
* Initial version, supports Sketch 3.4... not yet tested in 3.5beta

## Description
For when you want to create those circluar segmented objects as seen in gauges or fitness apps.
A dialog will ask for 3 comma separated values: radius , number of segments and thickness. Thickness is optional and describes the thickness of the "donut" created. If this value is set to zero or ommitted the segmented circle gets created as a line. Preserves last used value across sessions.

## Installation
Download the .zip file. Double click the .sketchplugin file inside the opened folder.
(Newer versions of Sketch might have automatic updates for plugins. Will update when that is available)
